Revision history for App-OTRS-CreateTicket

1.15  2015-04-22
 - Bundle example webservice configuration file in dist. Previously I used
   an URL to the OTRS repo but they changed file names causing breakage.
 - Force ticket and article parameters to string in generated SOAP
   to prevent binary serialization in some circumstances. Thanks to
   TitovLab for reporting. Fixes Github issue #2.

1.14  2014-05-28
 - Add --PendingTime option for pending states.
   This option takes a date in YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM format, or a number,
   which is handled as the number of minutes from current time.

1.13  2013-11-13
 - Add --TimeUnit option, which is required on some servers.
     Thanks to @jensoliver for reporting!
   Note that because of https://github.com/OTRS/otrs/pull/157
   on OTRS systems, you might not be able to set it to '0'.
